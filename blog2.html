 <p class="big"> It was like i was picking a partner of a lifetime. Even tho I had a hard time playing with sceptile due to its grass type being a bummer in the hoenn region. That did not stop me from playing him most of the time possible. Eventually sceptile became irreplacable to me that i have to play pokemon emerald with him. In the later versions I played him even more because gamefreak gave him another alternate form in mega evolution.</p>

<p class="big"> This made me happier than before as i would never thought sceptile could look more badass than before. Plus they have added a dragon type in him which made it all the more cooler. I also like the fact that the anime also gives love to him by not only letting him appear in the hoenn region as Ash's Powerhouse but as well as leeting him be seen in the Kalos Region as seen in the video below fighting ash . </p>
