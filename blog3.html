  <p class="big"> When I got to play Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, when I was Fighting the champion Cynthia, I got Rekt by her Garchomp because chances are you only wanted this pokemon after fighting Cynthia bucause you only find gible in a certain area.

 <p class="big"> Gible likewise is always someone i adore because it looks like a baby that always needs care. You always have to feed in everywhere you go like a child. As it grow to be a Garchomp. It matures with it.</p>

<p class="big"> To be honest i was never a fan of garchomp's mega evolution due to it being not needed for an already strong pokemon. plus the design looks cringewrthy if you ask me. Regular Garchomp will always be better than anything else. </p>

<p ALIGN = "CENTER"> The anime showed that Garchomp is a forced to be reckonedwith as Garchomps normally annailate their opposition with ease as seen in the video. With these reason Garchomp is a part of my all time pokemon team. </p>
