      <p class="big"> Another Member of my Hoenn team is Gardevoir.  As much as people have a desire for gardevoir. She is a strong pokemon and if it is a desire you want. I suggest searching it on the internet as i feel it should be censored here. She was also the first pokemon i caught when i started playing pokemon. That is why she is memorable just like ash with butterfree :( </p>

 <p class="big"> well damn..... here we go with the megas again but the design made gardevoir from a queen to a goddess. The Stats are also godlike with her a she gains a big stat boost when using her. With These Reason Gardevoir is my 3rd pokemon</p>
