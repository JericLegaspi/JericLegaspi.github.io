  <p class="big"> Luxray reminds me of my dog. It's design is badass but the way i look at it. It reminds me of my dog most of the time.

 <p class="big"> The pokemon that that made me think this is a dog plus the way clemont's shinx bonded with him is enough for me to believed that this is a dog type pokemon or maybe a a wolf. But either way this pokemon can blast people with its electric attacks which made all the more better. With these reasons he is the 4th member of my team.</p>
