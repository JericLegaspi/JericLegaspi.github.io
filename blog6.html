  <p class="big"> OMG is this pokemon so hyped. This pokemon was projected to be the worst among the Kalos Starter but ended up being one of the most popular pokemon of all time. The Reason for it's design to be a ninja which automatically states that i would be a fan favorite. Add the way it is alternate form.

<p class="big"> The Anime really did a good job on ash's Greninja even tho it has it's own form called ash greninja. it beats out a lot of the pokemon with this form as it is a completely different pokemon. It almost manage to defeat mega gardevoir it the process but lost due to lack of experience. as part of this Greninja take the 5th spot</p>
