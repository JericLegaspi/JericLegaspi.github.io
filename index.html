  <h1><h1 ALIGN = "CENTER">My Pokemon Team</h1>
  <p class="big"> Hello there! My name is Jeric Legaspi, a student in De La Salle University currently taking up BS Civil Engineering. we all know that we have a stressful life here is la salle that we gradually play games. What game that stuck the most out of me is pokemon.
						For me Pokemon has been a staple of my childhood. I remember playing one with my gameboy when i was a kids. I would stay up hours just searching for a certain pokemon that i want to train. I used to also play competitively back in the day when the nintendo DS first came out. For the curious people, here a a preview of an competitive game from back from when it started and today's version. </p>
